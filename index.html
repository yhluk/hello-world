            <h2>Road Bike</h2>
            <p>What is Road Cycling? It's possible to define road cycling for beginners too narrowly. Broadly speaking,
                anyone who rides a bicycle on paved surface streets and roads — as opposed to off-road trails,
                backcountry landscapes, beaches or uncharted wilderness — is a road cyclist, whether the purpose of that
                cycling is errand running, messengering, commuting, recreating, exercising, adventuring, touring or
                racing. ountain bikers in Seattle are spoiled with several world-class trails just a short drive from
